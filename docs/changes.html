<h2>Version 2.04</h2>
<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several language files had wrong file types in Mac edition.</li>
<li><b>Source Package</b> The Config::IniFiles module version 2.13 had a 
bug that caused Report Magic to fail. This is fixed in newer versions. 
Source package users should make sure to update Config::IniFiles (this 
will be done automatically by Install.PL).</li>
<li>Added a check and message to note when the input file is in HTML 
not COMPUTER format. Previously you would get an out of memory error.</li>
<li>Improved documentation regarding order of precedence in stylesheets and 
style settings.</li>
<li>Some of the Chinese language files were missing. These are now included.</li>
<li>Fixed several HTML element problems in HTML 3.2 mode that caused strict 
parsers (like tidy) to produce errors.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.03</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can specify which hierarchical report level to graph with the <code>Graph_Level</code> 
setting in the <code>[reports]</code> section of your settings file</li> 
<li>Changed rmagic.sample to Unix line format, not DOS.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>docs/inst_src.html</code> to show <code>enable_shared</code> not 
<code>with_shared</code> as the jpeg configuration option.</li>
<li>Fixed documentation to show <code>Reverse_Time</code> in <code>[reports]</code> section.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in single-file (non-framed mode) where a target was 
specified for links when it should not have been.</li>
<li>Added a potential problem in the "Most Active" row to the FAQ.</li>
<li>(Source Package) Install.PL will now take a destination as the last argument 
not starting with a '-'. This means you no longer have to edit the file to choose 
the install location, rather you can simply specify '
<code>./Install.PL /usr/local/rmagic-$(VERSION)/</code>.' You can include the 
<code>$(VERSION)</code> key on the command line as well as in the file. If you 
specify a destination this way, documentation will be installed in 
<code>$DEST/docs/</code> regardless of the settings at the top of Install.PL.</li>
<li>(Source Package) Install.PL now boostrap updates CPAN.pm if necessary before 
loading anything else.</li>
<li>(Source Package) Added HTML::Tagset to the list of modules as it is now a 
prerequisite for HTML::Parser package.</li>
<li>(Source Package) Improved error handling and notification in Install.PL. 
Installation will now quit and notify you if any error occurs while installing 
a Perl module or one of the source files. This should make it easier to see 
where the problems are and work on them one at a time.</li>
<li>Changed alt text on logos so that it's shorter and more to the point.</li>
<li>Included details on setting Work Hours in the Hourly Summary in the 
<a href="advanced.html">Advanced Settings</a> section of the documentaion.</li>
<li>Changed the method Report Magic internally uses to determine if you are 
writing a single file or multiple file report. This has no effect on the use 
of Report Magic, except that it should be a more accurate guess in the case 
of sloppy punctuation.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where paths with 'top' and other keywords in them did not 
produce output files. Report Magic no properly distinguishes between keywords 
and paths or filenames in all instances.</li>
<li>Changed the font 'Sans Serif' to 'sans-serif' in all files</li>
<li>Added notes to <a href="advanced.html">Advanced Settings</a> to describe 
how to change linking in reports.</li>
<li>Font names with spaces in are quoted when written to a stylesheet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Stylesheet setting was overriding style settings.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where General Summary and Quick Summary weren't loading 
    some of their defaults properly. This requires the latest version of 
    Config::IniFiles on the source package.</li>
<li>Fixed more bugs in Install.PL regarding sample files.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when Quick Summary was enabled in single file mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Rows=ALL was not recognized in General Summary configuration.</li>
<li>Added notes in inst_src.html in the documentation for building libgd/</li>
<li>Fixed a file corruption bug in single file mode with Quick Summary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.01</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in single file mode that caused memory corruption</li>
<li>Fixed Install.PL on source package with the proper version number 
and right logo files</li>
<li>Fixed bug where default styles were set by RM when Stylesheet was 
set but  no style settings were given</li>
<li>Fixed bug where a blank line in the COMPUTER output made Report Magic 
think it had reached a FOOTER and stop parsing content</li>
<li>Improved clarity in documentation regarding the Stylesheet parameter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed bar graphs so that all bars a labelled.</li>
<li><code>[graphs] Format</code> is now correctly case insensitive.</li>
<li><code>[graphs] Format</code> JPEG and JPG are eqivalent.</li>
<li><code>[statistics] Log_File</code> now properly support date insertion and <code>${infile}</code> insertion.
  It DOES NOT support other <code>${XX}</code> insertions. It also uses the current system date
  for date insertions (as the <code>[statistics] File_In</code> does) not the end date of the data.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where most active summary was not formatted right.</li>
<li>Graphs can be individually set to '<code>lines2d</code>' to force just that report to use 2d 
  graphs. '<code>line2d</code>' or '<code>line3d</code>' specifies an absolute. '<code>line</code>' 
  is determined by the <code>[graphs] 3d</code> setting.</li>
<li>Bundle now include <code>rmagic.sample</code> and <code>sample.dat</code>. This will run with default 
  settings and produce a report in <code>reports/</code>. You can customize this by copying 
  it to rmagic.ini and adjusting your settings as desired.</li>
<li>Several rendering bugs and improvements were made to the graphing modules</li>
<li>Fixed bug in missing active column for pie charts. No longer warns if data in unavailable.</li>
<li>Directory report is no longer linked by default. If you want to have directories
  linked for some reason, add "<code>[DIRECTORY]IncludeLinks = */,[root directory]</code>" 
  to your settings file.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.99Beta2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moved sanity check in File_In/%infile% to Settings.pm.</li>
<li>Fixed where ${infile} could slip through sanity checks.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in detecting and returning errors on invalid settings files.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where Stylesheet settings weren't loaded properly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where new Bullet_Image setting wasn't being read.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs in STDOUT mode.</li>
<li>Put header and prefix back in message function, rather than formatMessage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.99Beta1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added [d], "Date of last access", to cdata.ini file.</li>
<li>Added units to the General Summary.</li>
<li>Moved formatting of date items in GeneralSumary to their field
  specs in cdata.ini.</li>
<li>Changed date formatting codes to use date of last request rather than current date
  EXCEPT for the input file. [statistics]File_In, if it contains date formatting codes,
  will be interpreted with the date the program is run on.</li>
<li>Comlpeted total rewrite of Report Magic so it is object oriented. This 
  should improve performance significantly and make future enhancements
  easier to implement.</li>
<li>Now recognizes unparsable date values in D and d columns and refuses to format 
  or parse them, but does so gracefully.</li>
<li>Localized the decimals in the Processing Time Report</li>
<li>Now tries to properly handle undefined or null date columns in Analog 4.1 and earlier.</li>
<li>Object oriented approach makes ReportTypes extensible; however, they are also, now, 
  case sensitive. ReportType values can be a single word (in which case it's searched for in  
  the wadg::rm::Report or root namespace) or it can be a fully qualified perl class (e.g. 
  company::reports::InternalReport). All valid reports must subclass wadg::rm::Report.</li>
<li>General Summary no longer needs to be first report; however, Report 
  Magic still requires the General Summary to be included or it won't 
  be able to parse the data file.</li>
<li>Report Magic now understands and parses Analog HEADER and FOOTER content.
  This content is added to the top and bottom of the report file or files.</li>
<li>Added additional filter information to handle 'all' (0r) and 
  'single' (1b) cases.</li>
<li>Filters are formatted more cleanly (less HTML overhead).</li>
<li>Rearranged report information order to put filter info first, then do 
  graphs, then data tables.</li>
<li>Moved Active_Column to [reports] and it's derivative section so that 
  it can be set for each one.</li>
<li>Added average summaries to time reports.</li>
<li>Handle N and l columns more portably by settings in cdata.ini
  e.g. [N]Type=Number; [l]Type=Level.</li>
<li>Added NumberFormat to cdata.ini to specify which columns show percent data.</li>
<li>Implemented a bunch of new options in new [graphs] section including
  2d/3d, fg color, bg color, width, height.</li>
<li>Add support for outputing in JPEG (though the file will be large...)
  in the [graph]Format setting. This can also be gif, but that's not
  supported without Image::Magick on your system and you're on your own 
  installing that.</li>
<li>Wrote Config:IniFiles update (from InoConf.pm) to support a tied 
  hash interface and importing settings from an existing object.</li>
<li>Wrote wadg::HTMLWriter object to allow encapsulation of HTML output
  methods regardless of output spec type (e.g. HTML 3.2, 4.0 or XHTML 1.0).</li>
<li>Deprecated 'conf' and 'cfg' file formats. Report Magic now only 
  accepts and understands 'ini' file formats and the command-line interface.</li>
<li>Convert to CSS (XHTML 1.0/Strict) with option for older HTML 3.2implemented 
through the [statistics]Format setting. In HTML 3.2 output, all styles are 
conveted to equivalent, valid elements to achieve (almost) the same display.</li>
<li>Added new 'stylesheet' setting to 'reports' and 'navigation' to allow
  complete control over the styles used in the output of the pages.</li>
<li>Created a new [graphs] section
	<ul>
	<li>Moved Graph_Font for [graphs]Font</li>
	<li>Ability to specify graph size with Width and Height</li>
	<li>Selectable 2d/3d graphs: 3d is default 3D = 0 is off.</li>
	<li>Set graph colors (foreground, background) (Font_Color,BG_Color)</li>
	<li>Set graph colors for set/data palette (Palette)</li>
	<li>Cycle colors on or off (cycle_Colors)</li>
	<li>Shadows on or off {Drop_Shadows}</li>
	<li>Differentiate graph and image background: BG_Color in [graphs] vs [reports]</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Added FONT and FONT_COLOR items to Data_* settings [ST]. 
  WARNING: Use of this with the HTML 3.2 output option can cause RM to create HUGE files!</li>
<li>If no [website]Title is given then a default message like "Website 
  statistics for HOST NAME" is used.</li>
<li>Added inheritance to rdata/cdata/lang files. First place is the default (. or lang/en/), then 
  whatever language is added then site. This should make maintaining language files easier.</li>
<li>Summary rows in daily and hourly summaries are now defined in rdata.ini rather 
  than hard-coded [ST]. This is implemented with a simple matching mechanism and
  appropriate label for the row.</li>
<li>For boolean settings, the following case-insensitive settings are equivalent
  (YES,ON,TRUE,[non-zero value]) == 1 and (NO,OFF,FALSE,NONE) == 0.</li>
<li>The insertion code and %infile% has been renamed ${infile}. Old codes will
  still work, but please start using the new format. It makes more sense...</li>
<li>Insertion codes have been expanded to include the folowing values, in addition 
  to date formatting:
  <pre>
	${infile}	This is the new way to specify the name of the input file.
	${XX}	Where XX is the any field on the General Summary

<li>The Header and Footer from Analog are now parsed for insertion codes.
<li>Added a pie chart for the OS, Organization, and Domain Reports. Removed 
  the bar chart from the Status Code report.</li>
<li>NOTE: When using XHTML 1.0 output, any styles defined in the stylesheet
  settings or created with conventional settings will be applied to 
  imported HEADER and FOOTER context. This will not happen in HTML 3.2 
  output.</li>
<li>PERFORMANCE NOTES: Running XHTML output is about 40% faster and 
  uses 40% of the disk space of HTML 3.2. (Of course this depends on 
  the number of settings for fonts and colors, the more settings the 
  largers the HTML 3.2 becomes and the longer it takes to create it.
  XHTML is hardly affected by additional colors and fonts.)</li>
<li>Changed default palette to 
  9999CC, CCCC66, 339900, 990000, FFCC33, 996699, 6699FF, 0066CC, FF9900, 666699</li>
<li>NOTE: Using TTF in graphs significantly affects performance!</li>
<li>Added [MONTHLY], [DAILY], [FULLDAILY], etc. report section capabilities 
  to rmagic.ini to allow rdata.ini settings to be set in rmagic.ini under 
  corresponding report section.</li>
<li>Allowed [reports] values to be overidden in each report section
  (e.g. [GENERAL], [MONTHLY], [FULLDAILY], etc.)</li>
<li>Filter and TimeReport summaries are written in 'smallfont' class.</li>
<li>Added support for elm.class (and elm#id) in HTMLWriter::HTML_3_2.</li>
<li>Added HTMLWRiter::HTML_3_2 support for span class= or id= .</li>
<li>Added HTMLWRiter::HTML_3_2 support for background-image.</li>
<li>Directory report now links [Root Directory] to '/'.</li>
<li>Added "other" bar to the end of bar charts if too many bars. [ST]</li>
<li>Moved [statistics]Summary_Rows to [QUICK]Rows and [statistics]General_Rows 
to [GENERAL]Rows.</li>
<li>No longer numbers or charts the [not listed] rows.</li>
<li>Improved handling of date floors a little more with a better 
  regexp and matches.</li>
