<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The first step to using Report Magic for Analog is to install it. You've 
probably already downloaded Report Magic (if not see the 
<a href="http://reportmagic.org/download.html">download 
page</a> online). Next you need to extract the archive into the directory 
you wish to install Report Magic in. For specific install instructions for 
each package choose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="inst_win.html">Windows Binary Package</a></li>
<li><a href="inst_mac.html">Macintosh Binary Package</a></li>
<li><a href="inst_src.html">Source Package</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing Your Installation</h2>
<p>After installing, it is a good idea to test the installtion. Report Magic ships
with some sample data you can use to test the setup. Here are the instructions to 
follow for testing, depending on your platform:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Source Package</dt>
<dd>From the rmagic directory, type <code>./rmagic.pl</code>. Report Magic will 
create a set of report files in the <code>reports/</code> directory. Verify these with 
your web browser (or <code>lynx</code>).</dd>

<dt>Windows Binary Package (Quick and Dirty)</dt>
<dd>From Explorer, go to 'Program Files', then 'WADigital', then 'ReportMagic'. 
Double-click the Report Magic icon. Report Magic will create a folder called 'reports' 
and put all the reports in there. Look for a file in the 'reports' folder called 
'index.html' and double-click it to see the results in your browser.</dd>

<dt>Windows Binary Package (Using a Command Prompt)</dt>
<dd>Go to Start|Program|Command Prompt (this may be elsewhere, like 
Start|Programs|Accessories|System Tools on ME or 2000). Enter <code>cd 
"\Program Files\WADigital\ReportMagic"</code>. Type <code>rmagic</code> and 
press enter. You will see the status as it creates the reports. When done, open 
the reports in the reports folder as described above.</dd>

<dt>Macintosh Binary Package</dt>
<dd>From the Report Magic folder, Double-click the Report Magic icon. 
Report Magic will create a folder called 'reports' and put all the reports in 
there. Look for a file called 'index.html' in the reports folder and 
double-click it to see the results in your browser.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Now, you'd probably like to get some results from your own logs. First, you 
will need to have <a href="http://www.analog.cx/">Analog</a> installed 
and configured on your system or server. If you have not done this already, 
go to the <a href="http://www.analog.cx/">Analog 
Web Site</a> and follow the instuctions there. While configuring Analog, it 
is helpful to use the OUTPUT HTML configuration (the default) so you can 
preview the reports to make sure they contain all the right data.</P>

<h3>Setting up Analog for use with Report Magic</h3>
<p>Now that you have Analog running, you will want to create a 
new Analog configuration file or modify your current one to tell 
Analog to create <b>Computer Readable Output</b>. (If you are creating a new 
configuration file for Report Magic, try to get it working in Analog with the standard 
Analog HTML output first. That way, you know what kind of results you'll be 
generating and you can isolate any problems with the analysis before you 
get to the formatting.) There are only two lines that need to be changed 
(or added) to an Analog configuration to make it work with Report Magic:</p>

<p>The first line to change tells Analog what kind of output to create. Find 
a line with that starts with the word <b>OUTPUT</b> and change it to read 
as follows. If no such line exists (as in the default configuration) just add 
this line anywhere in the Analog configuration file (although it's helpful to put
it next to the OUTFILE line, below).</p>
<dl><dd><code>
	OUTPUT COMPUTER
</code></dd></dl>

<p>The next line to change tells Analog where the output is going. We don't 
want to overwrite any existing Analog reports, and we're not creating HTML 
output so lets change the line starting with the word <b>OUTFILE</b> to:</p>
<dl><dd><code>
	OUTFILE report.dat
</code></dd></dl>

<p>(Of course, if you're running Report Magic in a different 
directory than Analog, then you'll probably want this file to end up there, 
so put in any path information necessary.)</p>

<P>Having done that, go ahead and run Analog with your new configuration file. 
Analog will tell you if there are any problems with the configuration you've 
created. If the configuration is good, Analog will create the 
<CODE>report.dat</CODE> computer readable output file that Report Magic uses.</P>

<P>MAC USERS: It will be easiest if, after creating your 
<CODE>report.dat</CODE> file, you copy/move it to the Report Magic directory. 
This way, when creating your Report Magic settings file, you won't need to 
worry about paths.</P>


<h3>Setting up Report Magic</h3>

<p>Next, you'll want to set up the output and formatting options for Report 
Magic. The easiest way to start is to make a copy of the <code>rmagic.sample</code> 
file in the distribution, rename it to <code>rmagic.ini</code> (<code>Report Magic.ini</code>
for the Mac Edition) and edit that. </p>

<p>In your new <code>rmagic.ini</code> file you will want to change the following
settings:</p>

<dl>
<dt>[statistics]<br />File_In</dt>
<dd>Set this to point the the file you created with Analog. If you copied it 
to the Report Magic directory, then just set this to <code>report.dat</code></dd>

<dt>[reports]<br />File_Out</dt>
<dd>Set this to the path where you want to write the report files.</dd>

<dt>[website]<br />Title</dt>
<dd>Give a title for your reports.</dd>

</dl>


<H2>Running Report Magic</H2>
<P>When your settings file is completed, you can run Report Magic for Analog 
to generate your report files.</p>
<p>On <b>Windows</b> just type this on the command line in the Report Magic 
directory or double click the Report Magic icon:</P>
<DL><DD><CODE>
	rmagic
</DL></DD></CODE>

<P>If you have the <b>source version</b> you can run it from a command line 
like this (assuming you installed Perl in /usr/bin/perl):</P>
<DL><DD><CODE>
	./rmagic.pl
</DL></DD></CODE>
<P>If you have a <b>Mac Binary</b> version just double click the Report Magic icon.</P>
<P>When Report Magic is complete you should have a new set of report files in 
the <CODE>reports</CODE> subdirectory. Open the file <CODE>index.html</CODE> 
with your web browser to start viewing your reports.</CODE>

<h2>Going Further</h2>
<p>Report Magic has a lot of options and configurations. The first things you 
will probably want to do is change some of the settings to configure the reports 
to look the way you want. Complete details of all the settings that Report 
Magic will understand can be found on the page 
<a href="config.html">Building your Settings File.</A></p>

<p>If you want to tell Report Magic to use a different settings file than 
<code>rmagic.ini</code> or you want to set options from the command-line 
(for scripts and scheduling, for example) see the page 
<a href="commands.html">Running Report Magic for Analog</a>.</p>

<a>If you learn better by example, take a look at some of the 
samples settings files and style sheets in the <code>samples</code> folder 
in the distribution. If you have other questions, check the 
<a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for the answer.</p>
