</UL>


<H2>Version 1.11 Service Release</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Windows Binary package creates PNG format graph files.</LI>
<LI>Fixed Report Magic version, added OS.</LI>
<LI>Added Analog version to bottom of reports when available.</LI>
<LI>Clarified character set usage in graphs and decomosed non-latin-2 
characters so that graphs are more accurately spelled in non-english.</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in the report maxima when Active_Column was not set.</LI>
<LI>Improved source so that it is 'strict'.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Version 1.1 General Release</H2>
<UL>
<LI>New setting is called <CODE>Log_File</CODE> and is under the 
<CODE>[statistics]</CODE> tells Report Magic to write all error or 
notification messages to a file instead of the display.</LI>
<LI>On Mac platform, only, new setting <CODE>Always_Quit</CODE> in the 
<CODE>[statistics]</CODE> section tells Report Magic to quit the program 
whenever any error occurs. (Normally it leaves the "console" window up so 
you can see any messages.) If you are using the logging option (above) it 
will also quit the program on errors. This option has no effect on non-Mac 
platforms.</LI>
<LI>New setting <CODE>No_Robots</CODE> in the <CODE>[statistics]</CODE> 
section tells Report Magic to add a NO_ROBOTS Meta tag to each output file. 
This tells robots who are spidering your site (and obey these robot 
exclusion rules extensions) not to index these pages.</LI>
<LI>New setting <CODE>Company_Logo</CODE> in the <CODE>[statistics]</CODE> 
section allows you to include your company logo or other statements in each 
report file. Using this option will hide the normal logos replacing them 
with the contents of the filename you provide.</LI>
<LI>If you install the new libgd / GD.pm, GIF files are no longer possible. 
Instead the superior PNG format is being used (this is due to patent issues 
with Unisys and the GIF file format). If you are upgrading from an older 
version and already have an older version of libgd then your will still 
get GIF images.</LI>
<LI>You can tell Report Magic reports to find images (currently just the 
logos) in a single place on the web, rather than in the local directory. The 
new setting <CODE>Image_Dir</CODE> under the <CODE>[reports]</CODE> section 
gives the location (directory) of the images in URL syntax. This can be a 
relative (e.g. '../images') or absolute (e.g. 
'http://www.hostserver.com/images/stats/') URL location.</LI>
<LI>New setting <CODE>Language</CODE> to the <CODE>[statistics]</CODE> 
section can be set to the language for that report. Report Magic looks in the 
<CODE>lang</CODE> directory under the directory it was installed in for a 
directory containing each language's set of files.</LI>
<LI>New setting <CODE>Verbose</CODE> under <CODE>[statistics]</CODE> allows 
you to control what kind of messages Report Magic tells when running. The 
valid values are N for Notices, W for Warnings and E for errors. The default 
is to output all. To tell Report Magic to be absolutely quiet use the keyword 
NONE.</LI>
<LI>You can include the contents of another setting file with the 
setting <CODE>Include</CODE> in the <CODE>[statistics]</CODE> section. This 
takes the name of a settings file whose values will be included.</LI>
<LI>Command-line options have been added that can override settings 
file settings. All the options use the same name as the settings file option 
with a '-' preprended. That is, the name of the section (in the .ini file 
format) follwed by and underscore ('_') followed by the parameter name.</LI>
<LI>New feature that you can use in output filenames in your 
settings file  to have them include a date. All output filenames (report, 
index, navigation page, output directory and error logging file) can now 
contain a code like <CODE>%yymmdd%</CODE> where the current date should be 
inserted. Everything between the '%' symbols is used as a date format 
specifier. See <A HREF="datefmts.html">the Date Format Reference</A> for 
details on the format string.</LI>
<LI>Output files can also use the key code <CODE>%infile%</CODE> to 
inserting the name of the input filename in the output file's name. Note 
that <CODE>%infile%</CODE> is the input file name without the extension.</P>
<LI>Graphs now use a new 3D style. This means bar charts and line charts 
are now extruded into a third dimmension. Pie charts, which were already 3D, 
have been fixed to include the labels when they are short enough.</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that caused Report Magic to not be able to interpret input 
files with a hostname that contained the character sequence 'IP'.</LI>
<LI>All fonts and colors are now handled as optional. If a font or color is 
not specified in the settings file, then no tag will be written. This should 
help to keep the file size down.</LI>
<LI>The color used for graph text, label and line colors was changed to 
match text color for reports (<CODE>reports_Text_Color</CODE>). The support 
is minimal (because of limitations in the GIFgraph module) but should help, 
especially when using a black background. You can use any text color that 
happens to be predefined by GIFgraph. This includes 'black' and 'white' as 
well as the following hex-code colors: </LI>
<LI>The setting <CODE>Title</CODE> was moved from the <CODE>[reports]</CODE> 
section to the <CODE>[website]</CODE> section. Exisiting settings files 
don't need to be changed -- Report Magic will read it either way. This 
just seems like a more logical place for it.</LI>
<LI>The <CODE>ColSpan</CODE> option in <CODE>rdata.ini</CODE> has been deprecated.
Report Magic now knows inherently how to span columns based on the type 
if report.</LI>
<LI>Internationalization was improved by spliting up Command-Output and 
HTML-Output items in language files. This was accomplished by changing the 
text in items <CODE>N0001</CODE>, <CODE>N0003</CODE> and <CODE>E0010</CODE> 
in <CODE>lang.ini</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Improved internationalization by implementing a %0, %1, %2, ... 
replacement formatting instead of the %s that was used in <CODE>lang.ini</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>With GD.pm 1.19 module from CPAN, there are new fonts for graphs to 
support Latin-1, Latin-2 and other character sets including 16-bit characters.</LI>
<LI>Item <CODE>S0009</CODE> under <CODE>[Text]</CODE> in 
<CODE>lang.ini</CODE> has been deprecated in favor of a more 
internationlaized solution: There is now a new item in <CODE>rdata.ini</CODE> 
for each report. '<CODE>MostActive</CODE>' provides the description used for 
the report by the Quick Summary. This way each report can be handled 
properly with respect to gender and case.</LI>
</UL>


<H2>Version 1.0 General Release</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Changed the date format specification used in the <CODE>rdata.ini</CODE>, <CODE>cdata.ini</CODE> 
and <CODE>lang.ini</CODE> files to use the symbol 'n' for minutes. This 
allows any character to separate times (as in italian 'h,nn').</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that cropped up in command-line specified settings files</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug that broke the date ouput on the general summary</LI>
<LI>Added percent symbols to all language files</LI>
<LI>Modified bar graph number formats to have no decimal values for 
	internationalization</LI>
<LI>Orgazined chart colors to be easily distiguishable by color-blind viewers</LI>
<LI>Unescaped any HTML Entities before writing graph text</LI>
<LI>Modified "Other" pie slice to only exists if it includes more than one 
	slice</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in the FLOOR descriptions</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Version 1.0 BETA 3</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Portability was achieved across all major Perl platforms</LI>
<LI>Five separate languages are now available</LI>
<LI>Pie and Bar charts in the same report use consistent coloring</LI>
<LI>Fixed a truncation problem for IP addresses</LI>
<LI>Fixed the Weekend summary names in Daily Summary to be locale compatible</LI>
<LI>Fixed a potential infinite loop problem in the getDateString member</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug which improperly handled rows with no data value name</LI>
<LI>Made capitalization consitent between chart type filenames and links</LI>
<LI>Report Magic now properly handles data rows with no data name</LI>
<LI>Report Magic now check for the existence of settings files before 
	trying to open them</LI>
<LI>Items like "[not listed: XXX]" will no longer appear in Quick Summary. 
	NOTE that the fix to this now makes it impossible to summarize any 
	items that have been OUTPUTALIASed to look like the above.</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug where the last digit of number was lost if ListSeparator 
	was blank or nonexistant</LI>
<LI>Removed the subtitle on bargraphs because it was not internationalized 
	and provided no more useful information.</LI>
<LI>The start and end times for the report period are now formatted exactly 
	like the report generation time. (O0008 under [Text] in lang.ini)</LI>
<LI>Swapped order of weekend and weekday summaries.</LI>
<LI>Changed the text of "Peak Time" to "Peak Entry".</LI>
<LI>Modified encoding of data values to support HTML-encoded data</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug whereby non-English languages didn't properly total 
	Weekends in the Daily Summary. (Why did the English one work?)</LI>
</UL>



<H3>Version 1.0 BETA 2</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Multilingual support in <CODE>lang</CODE> directory</LI>
<LI>New <CODE>statistics_Meta_Refresh</CODE> added to expire pages</LI>
<LI>Supports FLOOR and SORTBY data and column changes</LI>
<LI>Properly handles all fields of a D type column.</LI>
<LI>Properly handles date-type fields in General Summary.</LI>
<LI>Added support for 'f' floors and sort column in Analog 3.3 
	(Support for date floors though is very minimal.)</LI>
<LI>Report Magic now ignores lines containing unknown column specs.</LI>
<LI>Report Magic now only produces one error notice per line with an 
	unknown row spec (or column spec).</LI>
<LI>A placeholder is inserted if no graph can be created.</LI>
<LI>All files now have Unix line endings. This works on both platforms.</LI>
<LI>Added initial '/' in #!/bin/perl in perl source (Sorry!).</LI>
<LI>Table summaries no longer contain HTML tags.</LI>
<LI>Program does not assume both count and percent data.</LI>
</UL>


<H3>Version 1.0 BETA 1</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Configuration file format was changed to make it more readable.</LI>
<LI>Pie charts use only indices because of a rendering bug in the module.</LI>
<LI>Configuration option <CODE>statistics_Reverse_Time</CODE> added to 
flip chart data in Time Reports.</LI>
</UL>
