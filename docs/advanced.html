<p>Report Magic can get quite complicated and has many advanced options for 
users who want to learn. Below is a brief introduction to each option and 
some resources where you can find more information.</p>


<h3>Setting the Work Hours for the Hourly Summary</h3>
<p>You can change the hours used to compute and display 'Work Hours' and 
'After Hours' in the Hourly Summary by setting the <code>Summary1</code> and 
<code>Summary2</code> settings for the <code>[HOURLY]</code> report. The 
default configuration uses something like this (localized for your langauge):</p>

<pre>
[HOURLY]
Summary1 = [8-16],Work Hours (8:00am-4:59pm)
Summary2 = [0-7,17-23],After Hours (5:00pm-7:59am)
</pre>

<p>In the above, the numbers in brackets are the hours to cover for each Summary 
(these are comma-separated lists of numbers or ranges of numbers). The text after 
the "<code>],</code>" is displayed on the reports. So, for example, to start the 
workday at 10:00am and end at 7:00pm you would put something like this into your 
settings file:</p>

<pre>
[HOURLY]
Summary1 = [10-18],Work Hours (10:00am-6:59pm)
Summary2 = [0-9,19-23],After Hours (7:00pm-9:59am)
</pre>

<p>Notice that the hours are inclusive, so the Work Hours, 10-18, includes
every thing from the beginning of the hour 10 (10:00:00) to the end of the 
hour 18 (18:59:59 or 6:59:59pm).</p>

<h3>Changing links in reports</h3>
<p>To change hyperlinks in reports, you can set the <code>IncludeLinks</code>
setting for each individual report in your settings file. <code>IncludeLinks</code>,
takes a comma-separated list of patterns that, when matched will be linked. For
example, to link only pages in the request report you would use something like</p>
<pre>
    [REQUEST]
    IncludeLinks=*/,*.htm,*.html,*.asp,*.php
</pre>
<p>Of course, this does depend on your definition of what a page is.</p>

<h3>Insertion codes</h3>
<p>Several settings for Report Magic can accept <i>insertion codes</i>: codes
that tell Report Magic to insert specific text in the ouput. All filenames 
can accept insertion codes (such as <code>[statistics]File_In</code> or 
<code>[reports]File_Out</code>) as well as the <code>[website]Title</code> 
setting and the content that Analog puts into reports from its <code>HEADER</code> 
and <code>FOOTER</code> commands.<p>
<p>Insertion codes take two forms <code>%date format%</code> and 
<code>${something}</code>. The date format is applied to the current date for 
<code>[statistics]File_In</code> and <code>[statistics]Log_File</code> and to 
end date of the report for the all other settings. (This allows you to run reports 
for the end of the previous month on the first of each month and have filenames 
and titles reflect the proper period.) Date formats follow the formatting syntax 
as described in the <a href="datefmts.html">Date Format References</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the insertion codes insert values from the current run of Report 
Magic. The complete list of these codes is as follows:</p>
<pre>
     ${infile}          This is the name of the input file (from [statistics]File_In)
     ${XX}              Where XX is any row in the General Summary (listed <a href="columns.html#general">here</a>)
     ${GenerationTime}  This is the General Summary PS row, formatted for your locale
     ${DataStart}       This is the General Summary FR row, formatted for your locale
     ${DataEnd}         This is the General Summary LR row, formatted for your locale
     ${AnalogVersion}	This a synonym for the General Summary VE row
</pre>

<h3>Stylesheet format</h3>
<p>Using the <code>Stylesheet</code> setting in the <code>[navigation]</code> 
and <code>[reports]</code> sections, you can start setting styles instead of 
using settings like <code>BG_Color</code> and <code>Font</code>. Using stylesheets 
makes it easier to manage your styles and keep them consistent with the rest 
of your site. The stylesheet is used in the following manner:</p>
<pre>
	h1	The title at the top of each report file
	h2	The title of each individual report
	h4	Navigation page title
	th	Header columns on the data tables
	td.alt1	First color option for tabled data
	td.alt2	Second color option for tabled data
	th.total	Style options for summary rows at bottom of tables
	.fineprint	Style for time and range of report
	.smallfont	Style for 'SmallFonts' option in Simple reports
</pre>
<p>When using stylesheets, any style settings you add to your settings file 
(such as <code>[reports] Font</code> will override the styles defined in the 
stylesheets. If you only want to use the styles in your stylsheets, then remove 
all the other style settings from your settings file.</p>

<h3>Notes on the HTML in report files</h3>
<p>When Report Magic creates your report files, it writes all the HTML codes to 
a single line. This saves as much as 15% of the filesize, making the reports load 
faster and reducing the bandwidth they consume. Sometimes, though, you want to 
change the files or perhaps compare two files with <code>diff</code>. If you want 
to make the HTML more readable try the excellent tidy utility from W3C. You can 
download it from <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">here</a>, precompiled 
for many platforms. This will produce a more readable HTML format than any other 
option could do.</p>

<h3>Customizing report text</h3>
<p>As described in the <a href="repconf.html">Report Settings</a> page, you 
can create report-specific sections in your settings file and override report 
definitions to change display and text. The settings that you can change are 
those defined in the <code>rdata.ini</code> of the current language (plus any 
inherited from the English -- or default, see below -- language settings). Each 
<code>rdata.ini</code> file in the language subdirectories (e.g. <code>lang/en</code>) 
contains comments in the local language to help you understand what the settings 
mean and what can be done with them.</p>


<h3>Creating new language files</h3>
<p>The files in these language directories, <code>rdata.ini</code>, 
<code>cdata.ini</code> and <code>lang.ini</code> provide localizations 
for Report Magic. Specifically, they include interface, descriptions, reporting 
and graphing options for the reports created by Analog. These also contain all 
the text used in the report files created by Report Magic for Analog. If you are 
interested in creating a new language version or changing some of the text of 
the output, your can modify these files. But keep a backup, because you could 
easily make changes the Report Magic won't understand. Report Magic looks in a 
subdirectory of <code>lang</code> as specified in the <code>[statistics] 
Language</code> setting for language files. So if you are creating custom versions 
of an existing language you could create your own directory (such as 
'<code>my_es</code>') under <code>lang</code> and then specify that directory as 
your language setting. e.g. "<code>Language=my_es</code>"</p>

<p>The files in the language directories contain some (albeit minimal) documentation 
for what all the setting are. Additional help for translators is available in the 
'Developers and Translators' page on the 
<a href="http://www.reportmagic.org/">Report Magic website</a>.</p>

<h3>Creating custom reports</h3>
<p>Report Magic can use custom reports instead of the predefined reports that 
ship with it. To create a custom report, you need to be familiar with Perl. You 
create a Perl module that inherits from <code>wadg::rm::Report</code>, and then 
specify your new class as the <code>ReportType</code> for any report you want 
to have use it. The <code>Report.pm</code> contains documentation with each method
describing what the method is used for. <i><b>However</b>, the API may change in 
a future release of Report Magic</i>. This doesn't mean you shouldn't make custom 
reports, if you're so inclined. Rather, if you do, please join the 
<a href="http://www.reportmagic.org/lists.html">Report Magic Announce list</a> to 
hear of any pending changes and/or communicate with <a href="mailto:dgsupport@wadsack-allen.com">
Wadsack-Allen Digital Group</a> if you have any changes you'd like to request in the API.</p>
