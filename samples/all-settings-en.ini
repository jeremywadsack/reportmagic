# Report Magic for Analog 2.20 Settings File
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# This file contains all the Report Magic settings.
# (Comments are lines starting with '#' and are ignored by Report Magic.)
# You should change the values to match your site information.
# Minimally, the following need to be changed:
#	File_In = report.dat
#	Active_Column = R
#	Webmaster = webmaster@mydomain.com
#	Base_URL = http://www.mydomain.com
#
# ----------------------------------------------
# MAC USERS: The output path, below, is specified in Unix format 
# (which works for Unix and Windows systems). To run this on 
# the Macintosh platform, change the path to use ':'. 
#	File_Out = :reports:
# If using the Bullet_Image navigational item, remember to use Unix-style
# path specifiers here, because this is the image tag on the web page:
# 	Bullet_Image = images/bullet.gif
#
# ----------------------------------------------
#

# ----------------------- statistics --------------------------
# These settings describe how the statisitcs reports are generated.
#	File_In is the location of the computer readable output from analog. 
#		This can be the symbol "-" to designate that the CRO data 
#		will come from STDIN (or a pipe).
#	Frame_File_Out (optional) is the name and location of the frameset 
#		page. If no value is given, this defaults to 'index.html' unless 
#		[navigation]File_Out is also not used, in which case no frameset 
#		is created at all.
#	Frame_Border (optional) sets the width of the border of the frameset (0 for none)
#	No_Robots (optional) if set to 1 will add a META tag to each report 
#		file to tell robots not to index the file.
#	Log_File (optional) this can be set to the name of a file that Report 
# 		Magic will log all messages to.
#	Always_Quit (optional, Mac only) if set to 1 will force Report Magic to
#		Quit, even if errors occur. Use this with the 'cron' utility on Macs.
#	Language (optional) tells Report Magic what language to use in generating the 
#		reports. The language file must be in the subdirectory of its 
#		name in the lang subdirectory in the Report Magic directory. 
#		That is, to run the report in German you would use 'de' for the 
#		language and the files are found in rmagic/lang/de. (Default = en)
#	Include (optional) will include all the settings from the specified ini file 
#		overriding those with the settings in this file.
#	Verbose (optional) is a set of letters indicating what kind of messages to 
#		output when running. Valid values are N for notices, W for warnings 
#		and E for errors. Use NONE for no messages at all. (Default = NWE)
#	Format (optional) specifies the output file format for the reports. Currently
#               accepted formats are 'XHTML 1.0' (which uses CSS style sheets) and
#               'HTML 3.2' (which uses lots of <FONT> tags). Default is 'XHTML 1.0'.

# ----------------------- graphs --------------------------
#	BG_Color (optional) allows you to specify a color to be used for the

#               report page background color.
#	Font (optional) allows you to specify a TrueType Font to use for the

#               effect on your version of Report Magic.
