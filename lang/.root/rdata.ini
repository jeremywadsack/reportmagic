#
# NOTES ON SETTINGS
#
# ShortName
# This corresponds to the Analog config file report name. It should be 
# unique within the scope of all reports.
#
# ReportType
# This tell what type of report to generate. The following options are 
# available:
#	General - The General Summary
#	TimeReport - Any time report (e.g. Monthly Report, Weekly Report)
#	TimeSummary - Any time summary (e.g. Daily Summary, Hourly Summary)
#	Range - Reports that provide data in ranges (e.g. File Size, Processing Time)
#	Simple - A simple report, usable for most data
#	HierarchicalReport - A report with items in hierarchies
#	Quick - The Quick Summary
#	
# Truncate
# This option is available for Simple and Hierarchical reports. It tells the number of 
# characters to truncate the displayed text at. 
#
# IncludeLinks
# This option is available for Simple and Hierarchical reports. If set then the 
# data points will be hyperlinked according to the wildcard matching. This can be a
# comma-separated list of wildcards matches. So, for example, "*" will link every entry 
# and "*.html,*.htm,*/" will match page requests.
#
# SmallFont
# This option is available for Simple and Hierarchical reports. If set to 1, then the 
# data will be displayed in a smaller typeface
#
# GraphType
# This tells what type of graph(s) (if any) to use. If nothing is given, then 
# the report has no graphs. Otherwise you can choose 'Bar', 'Line', or 
# 'Pie'. More than one type can be used by separating them with commas. The 
# Bar and Line graphs only work on count data (number of requests, pages or 
# bytes). The Pie graph only works on percent data (percent of requests, 
# pages or bytes).
