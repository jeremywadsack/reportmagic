# Descriptions for columns and lines in reports
# Last Updated: 2000 August 25 By: JW
# For use with Report Magic for Analog 2.0
# Compatible with Analog 4.11
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# HOW TO USE AND MODIFY
#
# In each section, you can change descriptive text for another 
# language. Below is a list of the parameters (keys) and what they mean.
#
# LongName
# This field specifies the descriptive name given to columns in all reports 
# and rows in the General Report and Quick Summary. 
#
# Type
# This field tells Report Magic a little about how to present the column's 
# contents. Valid types are as follows:
#     Data     Will be shown in a table (default)
#     Filter   This is some kind of filter or sort information (like 
#              FLOOR or SORT) and is written as plain text. Filter columns
#              are handled with a series of regular expression matches. This
#              is descibed below with the [f] column.
#     Index    This type of column will set the Index number for the row. e.g. [N_]
#     Level    This type of column gives a level in a hierarchical report. e.g. [l]
#
# Unit
# Units
# On General Summary columns (rows) this is the singular and plural for
# the units (if any) for the given line.
#
# Activity
# In Time Reports, there is a summary line that list the most active entry 
# and the average for the period. This is followed by activity data for each 
# column in the report. The 'Activity' parameter gives the text used to 
# describe the level of activity for that column.
#
# NumberFormat
# All columns can now be given a number format for formatting. Without a format
# the number is shown normally. For percentage values a format of '#.#%' will
# display the number with a localized percent sign after the value. See 
# docs/numfmt.html for details on the format spec.
#
# Width
# This tells the CRO parser how many columns wide the column specifier is. For 
# example, the [D_] column actually has 5 columns of data so its width is 5.
#
# TimeFormat
# This is used to format the date or time data in columns that have that 
# data (e.g. [D_] and [d]). See docs/datefmt.html for details on the format spec.

# These filters use a slightly different set of options than other columns.
# Filters will parse their data value and output a text description. For 
# each filter you can have any number of Columns specified by Width.
# Each Column can have any number of Matches, LongNames and Result sets:
#
# 	ColX_MatchX	The Regular Expressions (without //) to match the contents 
# 	      	     of the filter data.
# 	ColX_LongNameX The basic text of the output string for the corresponding 
# 	        	     filter match. Replacements from the matches are %1-%9
# 	ColX_ResultX_n	The replacement text (if any) for the matched variables. The 
# 	        	     format for this matchset[tab]output text. If no result set is 
#	       	     given, then the match variable is outputted as listed. If a 
# 	        	     result line starts with the [tab] then that will be used when 
# 	       	     no match is made in the set.
