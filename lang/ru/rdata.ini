# For use with Report Magic for Analog 2.0
# Compatible with Analog 4.11
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# HOW TO USE AND MODIFY
#
# In each section, you can change descriptive text for another 
# language. You can change the types of graphs used in each report (if any). 
# And you can set some display and formatting options. Below is a list of 
# the parameters (keys) and what they mean.
#
# ShortName
# This corresponds to the Analog config file report name. It should be 
# unique within the scope of all reports.
#
# LongName
# This field specifies the descriptive name (title) given to the reports.
#
# DataName
# This is the name of the data type in tables and graphs (e.g. Monthly 
# Report shows Data for each "Month")
#
# ReportType
# This tell what type of report to generate. The following options are 
# available:
#	General - The General Summary
#	TimeReport - Any time report (e.g. Monthly Report, Weekly Report)
#	TimeSummary - Any time summary (e.g. Daily Summary, Hourly Summary)
#	Range - Reports that provide data in ranges (e.g. File Size, Processing Time)
#	Simple - A simple report, usable for most data
#	HierarchicalReport - A report with items in hierarchies
#	Quick - The Quick Summary
#	
# Truncate
# This option is available for Simple and Hierarchical reports. It tells the number of 
# characters to truncate the displayed text at. 
#
# IncludeLinks
# This option is available for Simple and Hierarchical reports. If set then the 
# data points will be hyperlinked according to the wildcard matching. This can be a
# comma-separated list of wildcards matches. So, for example, "*" will link every entry 
# and "*.html,*.htm,*/" will match page requests.
#
# SmallFont
# This option is available for Simple and Hierarchical reports. If set to 1, then the 
# data will be displayed in a smaller typeface
#
# TimeFormat
# This gives a format specifier for displaying time data. You can use 'm' for 
# months, d for days, y for years, h for hours or 'n' for minutes. In general one or 
# two repeated codes give a number of at least that many digits. "mmm" for 
# months gives a three letter abbreviation and "mmmm" gives a full month 
# name (see ShortMonths and LongMonths in lang.ini). "www" and "wwww" 
# correspond the the weekday abbreviations and names (see shortDays and 
# longDays in lang.ini). A more complete description of the date 
# formatting is in the docs in docs/datefmts.html.
#
# GraphType
# This tells what type of graph(s) (if any) to use. If nothing is given, then 
# the report has no graphs. Otherwise you can choose 'Bar', 'Line', or 
# 'Pie'. More than one type can be used by separating them with commas. The 
# Bar and Line graphs only work on count data (number of requests, pages or 
# bytes). The Pie graph only works on percent data (percent of requests, 
# pages or bytes).
#
# MostActive
# This is the phrase used in the quick summary reports. Usually something
# like 'Most active week' or 'Most active browser'.
#
# Average
# The phrase used in summaries to describe average results over the report.
# For example, "Monthly average." This is currently only applicable to 
# TimeReport type reports.
#
# SummaryN
# This describes one or more Summary rows appended to a TimeSummary type report.
# The format of the option is a range specifier in brackets followed by the text 
# to be used for the summary row label. The range specifier can be a comma-separated
# list of values (e.g. [1,7]) or a range indicated with a hyphen (e.g. [7-16]). Ranges
# are inclusive.
#
# Description
# This is the long text description provided at the top of each report.
