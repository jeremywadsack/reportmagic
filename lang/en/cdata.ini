# Descriptions for columns and lines in reports
#
# Last Updated: 14 February 2003 By: JW/WADG

#
# HOW TO USE AND MODIFY
#
# In each section, you can change descriptive text for another 
# language. Below is a list of the parameters (keys) and what they mean.
#
# LongName
# This field specifies the descriptive name given to columns in all reports 
# and rows in the General Report and Quick Summary. 
#
# Unit
# Units
# On General Summary columns (rows) this is the singular and plural for
# the units (if any) for the given line.
#
# Activity
# In Time Reports, there is a summary line that list the most active entry 
# and the average for the period. This is followed by activity data for each 
# column in the report. The 'Activity' parameter gives the text used to 
# describe the level of activity for that column.
#
# TimeFormat
# This is used to format the date or time data in columns that have that 
# data (e.g. [D_] and [d]). See docs/datefmt.html for details on the format spec.

# These filters use a slightly different set of options than other columns.
# Filters will parse their data value and output a text description. For 
# each filter you can have any number of Columns specified by Width.
# Each Column can have any number of Matches, LongNames and Result sets:
#
# 	ColX_MatchX	The Regular Expressions (without //) to match the contents 
# 	      	     of the filter data.
# 	ColX_LongNameX The basic text of the output string for the corresponding 
# 	        	     filter match. Replacements from the matches are %1-%9
# 	ColX_ResultX_n	The replacement text (if any) for the matched variables. The 
# 	        	     format for this matchset[tab]output text. If no result set is 
#	       	     given, then the match variable is outputted as listed. If a 
# 	        	     result line starts with the [tab] then that will be used when 
# 	       	     no match is made in the set.
