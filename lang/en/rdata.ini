# Descriptions and titles for reports

#
# HOW TO USE AND MODIFY
#
# In each section, you can change descriptive text for another 
# language. You can change the types of graphs used in each report (if any). 
# And you can set some display and formatting options. Below is a list of 
# the parameters (keys) and what they mean.
#
# LongName
# This field specifies the descriptive name (title) given to the reports.
#
# DataName
# This is the name of the data type in tables and graphs (e.g. Monthly 
# Report shows Data for each "Month")
#
# TimeFormat
# This gives a format specifier for displaying time data. You can use 'm' for 
# months, d for days, y for years, h for hours or 'n' for minutes. In general one or 
# two repeated codes give a number of at least that many digits. "mmm" for 
# months gives a three letter abbreviation and "mmmm" gives a full month 
# name (see ShortMonths and LongMonths in lang.ini). "www" and "wwww" 
# correspond the the weekday abbreviations and names (see shortDays and 
# longDays in lang.ini). A more complete description of the date 
# formatting is in the docs in docs/datefmts.html.
#
# MostActive
# This is the phrase used in the quick summary reports. Usually something
# like 'Most active week' or 'Most active browser'.
#
# Average
# The phrase used in summaries to describe average results over the report.
# For example, "Monthly average." This is currently only applicable to 
# TimeReport type reports.
#
# SummaryN
# This describes one or more Summary rows appended to a TimeSummary type report.
# The format of the option is a range specifier in brackets followed by the text 
# to be used for the summary row label. The range specifier can be a comma-separated
# list of values (e.g. [1,7]) or a range indicated with a hyphen (e.g. [7-16]). Ranges
# are inclusive.
#
# Description
# This is the long text description provided at the top of each report.

hosted on an IIS system that reports in 100th second intervals rather than

DataName = Virtual Host
MostActive = Virtual host causing the most redirections
Description = <<EOT
The Virtual Host Redirection Report lists the top virtual hosts (or sub-hosts or
sub-domains) hosted on your server, ranked by the number of redirections they
caused. Redirections are HTTP status codes that indicate the visitor was directed

DataName = User Name
MostActive = User name causing the most failures
Description = <<EOT
The User Failure Report lists user names that were used in an attempt to
